GitHub-Backup
=============

By Chris Lockfort (devnull@csh.rit.edu) (Github username: Clockfort)

GitHub-Backup makes a local backup copy of all of a github user's  (or github organization's) repositories. 

This is useful in many cases:
* GitHub suddenly explodes.
* GitHub goes out of business.
* Your corporation's backup policies are more stringent than GitHub's.
* You have spotty/no internet access - perhaps you'd like to have all of your repositories available to code on while you ride the train?
* You are paranoid tinfoil-hat wearer who needs to back up everything in triplicate on a variety of outdated tape media.
